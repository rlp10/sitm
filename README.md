Sitm
====

Sitm is the Self-Improving Task Manager.

As well as acting as a task management program, it also helps you to adopt strategies to increase your productivity and mood.  The program does this by recommending different strategies to you, and then analysing what effect they have upon your productivity.  By identifying those which are most effective at increasing your productivity, you can become both more efficient and motivated.
