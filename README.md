Sitm
====

Sitm is the Self-Improving Task Manager.

As well as acting as a task management program, it also helps you to adopt strategies to increase your productivity.  The program does this by offering a number of plugins which can be enabled or disabled.

Status
------

Currently a basic command line task management system has been written, along with the plugin framework.

Usage
-----

```bash
$ sitm add "do something cool" # add a task

$ sitm next # prints the next task
do something cool 

$ sitm ls # lists all pending tasks, with id number
0   do something cool

$ sitm do # marks next task as done

$ sitm do --id 11 # marks task with id 11 as done

$ sitm rm # removes next task

$ sitm plugins # lists plugins
...

$ sitm enable test # enables plugin called test

$ sitm disable test # disables plugin called test

sitm -h # show all subcommands

```
